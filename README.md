I am a currnt Computer Science student at the University of Alabama🐘, and I am pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science as well as a Masters in Business Administration.
I have been programming since the seventh grade(when I won the congressional app challenge🚀). Computers are my life and I am always looking to learn more about them!
